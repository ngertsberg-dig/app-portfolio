      <h1> Mars </h1>
      <p>
        Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun
          and the second-smallest planet in the Solar
          System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman
          god of war, it is often referred to as the "Red Planet"
          because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it
          a reddish appearance.Mars is a terrestrial planet with
          a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both
          of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts,
          and polar ice caps of Earth.
          <br><br><br>
          There are ongoing investigations assessing the past
            habitability potential of Mars, as well as the possibility
            of extant life. Future astrobiology missions are planned,
            including the Mars 2020 and ExoMars rovers.
            Liquid water cannot exist on the surface of Mars due to low
            atmospheric pressure, which is about  6⁄1000 that of the Earth's,
            except at the lowest elevations for short periods.

  <p>

    Earth and Mars are similar when it comes to their basic makeups,
      given that they are both terrestrial planets. This means that both
      are differentiated between
      a dense metallic core and an overlying mantle and crust composed
      of less dense materials (like silicate rock).
      <br><br>
    Atmospheric pressure and temperatures are another way in which Earth
     and Mars are quite different. Earth has a dense atmosphere composed
      of five main layers – the Troposphere, the Stratosphere, the Mesosphere,
      the Thermosphere, and the Exosphere. Mars’ is very thin by comparison,
      with pressure ranging from 0.4 – 0.87 kPa – which is equivalent to about
      1% of Earth’s at sea level.
